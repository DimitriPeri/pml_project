# pml_project

In this project, our goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants, that were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways, in order to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the classe variable in the training set.

We train a predictive model with the Random Forest method and Repeated Cross Validation and use it to predict 20 different test cases.
